## Description 

Create a social media platform to debate hot topics with friends. 

## User Story 

As a debator with limited means I want to better my understanding on a given topic compared to other user.
Then I either create a debate or choose a debate to be a part of with a challenger.
As a challenger with a debate in mind I write my opinion challenging the incumbents opionion to be judged by the spectators.
